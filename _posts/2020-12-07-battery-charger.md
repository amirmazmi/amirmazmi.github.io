&emsp;&emsp;There are a lot of small solutions I would like to deploy around the house, be it using arduinos, raspi or even just a simple analog circuit. In most cases, an outlet is either too far or it would require pulling a long extension cable. Next, there is the simple fact that these solutions do not actually require 220-240V AC as typically they require 5V or 12V DC. 

&emsp;&emsp;For a long time, even as I was tinkering with the various boards and modules this problem was always at the back of my mind. A few years ago, I bought a box of solar cells and it unfortunately had to stay in the box as I moved to Sydney and Singapore. Soon I realized that I was trying this big problem in one go instead of in smaller pieces. This realization came about recently when I bought some 18650 cells and assembled a fan to blow away some of the fumes during soldering jobs.

&emsp;&emsp;As I was previously living abroad and did not have the space (living in small apartments) or the tools (most of it was left back home, again small apartment), now that the virus forced all of us into lockdown at home, I decided it was time to restart my tinkering. First, would be to focus on the batteries first. Starting with the assumption that I could always charge batteries using power bricks
