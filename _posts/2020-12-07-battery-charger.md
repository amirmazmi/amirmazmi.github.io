&emsp;&emsp;There are a lot of small solutions I would like to deploy around the house, be it using arduinos, raspi or even just a simple analog circuit. In most cases, an outlet is either too far or it would require pulling a long extension cable. Next, there is the simple fact that these solutions do not actually require 220-240V AC as typically they require 5V or 12V DC. 

&emsp;&emsp;For a long time, even as I was tinkering with the various boards and modules this problem was always at the back of my mind. A few years ago, I bought a box of solar cells and it unfortunately had to stay in the box as I moved to Sydney and Singapore. Soon I realized that I was trying this big problem in one go instead of in smaller pieces. This realization came about when I bought some 18650 cells and assembled a fan to blow away some of the fumes during soldering jobs.

&emsp;&emsp;So, as the virus has forced all of us into lockdown at home, I decided it was time to start at the batteries first. Starting with the assumption that I could always charge batteries using power bricks
